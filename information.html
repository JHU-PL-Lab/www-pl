<h2>Programming Languages Course Information</h2>
<h3>Textbook</h3> The textbook for the course is the on-line <a
href="../plbook">Book</a>, which is an extended version of the lecture
notes.  The course will cover almost the whole book from
beginning to end.  The book doesn't contain an introduction to
Caml; we will be following <a href="lectures/caml-intro.html">these
lecture notes</a> for that.<p>

<h3>The Course Bulletin Board</h3> <p> The course bulletin board is on
the menu, <a href="bb/index.php">BBoard</a>.  <strong>You
will need to register for the bboard</strong> using the Register link;
please do that immediately so you can see the course announcements
posted to the bulletin board.  You will be notified by email as well
when there is a new announcement, to make sure you do not miss any
critical announcements.  <p> The bulletin board also has a forum for
<a
href="bb/viewforum.php?f=2">questions
and discussions</a>; please ask questions you have there, and the prof
and TA's or fellow students will answer them.

<h3> Assignments </h3> All assignments are found in the <a
href="assignments/">assignments</a> directory.<p>

There will be three kinds of assignments
<ol>
  <li> Small programming assignments in Caml so you can learn
       the language, at the start of the course.
  <li> The implementation of a series of simple interpreters and
       translators in Caml. 
  <li> An assignment to write a translator from a high-level language into a
primitive subset of C.  The goal of this assignment is a conceptual
(as opposed to practical) understanding of what compiling is all about.
  <li> Written assignments covering topics in the mathematical theory of
       programming languages.
</ol>

<h3>Grading</h3>
Approximately 2/3 of the grade will be from assignments and 1/3 from
an examination.  I hope I can give lots of A's.

</ul><h4>Ethics</h4>
As with all your coursework and your life in general for that matter, you are expected
to act ethically.  See the <a href="http://ethics.jhu.edu">The JHU 
Ethics site</a> for more details on the university's ethics policy,
and also read the <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/integrity-code">CS
Department's academic integrity code</a>.
<ul>
  <li> It is considered cheating to copy code from another student's
    assignment or for two students to share code (this includes code
    from assignments submitted in past 
    years).  It is not even allowed for you to show any working code
      you have to another student.  You may ask another student for
      help with code you have that is not working.  If you are helping
      such a student, you cannot show them your correct code as a way
      of answering their question.  It is not considered cheating to discuss general
    ideas on how to solve a problem with another student. 
<li>Cheating is immoral. Cheaters that are caught will be punished as
    is required under University policy.  Please report all instances
    of cheating you see to the professor.  This is an unpleasant task
    but the alternative to not reporting it is worse.
<li>Clear-cut cases of cheating will be reported to the Undergraduate
    Academic Ethics Board.  If a student is found guilty, this information is
    placed on their permanent academic record. 
<li>If some action seems a grey area to you, <em>please ask first</em>
    before proceeding!
</ul>
