<h2><A NAME="xtocid2170322">Small Step Operational Semantics</A></h2>
The small step view of computation shows directly the steps that occur
and the order they occur in.<p>

Two examples of small-step computation:
<pre>
3 + 4 * 2 -> 3 + 8 -> 11

(Fn x => x + 2) (3 + 2 + 5) -> (Fn x => x + 2) (5 + 5) ->(Fn x => x + 2) (10) -> 10 + 2 -> 12 </pre>

<ul>
  <li> Computation is carried out by transforming (rewriting) the
program text
  <li> Functions are applied by textually replacing the parameter
       variable with the actual argument (<em>substitution</em>)
  <li> Each <code>-></code> is an atomic "step" of computation
  <li> Steps occur linearly, one after another, in the course of computing
  <li> Eventually no more steps are possible: a <em>value</em> has
       been reached.
</ul>
Advantage of transformational view: operational semantics for a big
language can be defined in a page of text.
  
Linear, stepwise view given above:  models precisely the ordering
of events in time.  <br>
This is known as the <em>small-step</em>
representation of computation, each step <code>-></code> is small.<p>
