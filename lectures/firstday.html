<h2>Programming Languages First Day Checklist</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Webpage: go over menus
  <li>Prof and TA(s)
  <li>BBOARD!!
  <li>Course overview (see homepage)
      <ol>

	    assignments related to prev. years but no using.
	<li>Attendance in lecture is not optional.
      </ol>
  <li>Prereqs: Mathematical maturity (including discrete math, data
      structures, automata and computability) and general computer
      experience. 
  <li>Sophomores <em>please see me after class</em>. 
  <li>My On-line book. 
      <ul>
	<li>The book is pretty much the lecture.  <em>But</em>, it is
	    still a "beta" version so it is still pretty critical to
	    come to lectures.  Recommend printing out a chapter at a
	    time since it will be improving over the course.
      </ul>

	    ugrad lab, get an account form from NEB 226)
