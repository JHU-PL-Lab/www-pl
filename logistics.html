<h3 id="class-times">Class Times</h3>

<p>We will meet 1:30-2:45PM on Mondays and Wednesdays in Hodson 110, and in parallel on Zoom.  lectures will also be recorded and uploaded to Panopto.</p>

<h3 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>We will be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/G9E051068">CampusWire</a> for announcements and Q&amp;A. You must register for CampusWire via the link you should have been emailed.  If you added the course late, see the course Blackboard site for the link.  We won’t be using Blackboard for anything else.</p>

<h3 id="zoom-and-panopto-locations">Zoom and Panopto Locations</h3>

<p>See the CampusWire site for those links.  They are also posted on the course Blackboard site.</p>

<h3 id="the-book">The Book</h3>

<p>The book for the course is the on-line <a href="book/index.html">Book</a>, which directly complements the lectures. The course will cover most of the book, but leaving out Chapter 8. The book doesn’t contain an introduction to OCaml; we will be doing running examples in class as the lecture, from file <a href="ocaml/code/lecture.ml">lecture.ml</a>. See the <a href="ocaml">OCaml page</a> for material on learning OCaml. Some of the later lecture topics are also not in the book lecture notes for those topics are found on the <a href="dateline.html">dateline</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gradescope">Gradescope</h3>

<p><a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> will be used for assignment submission and grade posting. See CampusWire for the entry code.</p>

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>

<p>All assignments are linked from the <a href="dateline.html">dateline</a>. There will be three kinds of assignments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Small programming assignments in OCaml so you can learn the language, at the start of the course.</li>
  <li>The implementation of a series of simple interpreters and translators in OCaml.</li>
  <li>Written assignments covering topics in the mathematical theory of programming languages.</li>
</ol>

<p>The collaboration policy for assignments is you are <em>strongly encouraged</em> to form teams of up to four people to work together on solving the assignments, but everyone must submit their own writeup of the answers (no emailing solutions to each other). Those of you who understand the material are encouraged to engage in peer teaching to help other students on your team or other teams.</p>

<p>We have several <em>Collab Lab</em> slots each week when your group can meet together and work, and have us around to get feedback or help from. The collab lab is described in more detail below.</p>

<p>Please make sure to consult the course <a href="integrity.html">Academic Integrity Policy</a> on what is legitimate interaction for homeworks, it is spelled out in detail there.</p>

<h4 id="late-hw-policy">Late HW Policy</h4>

<p>You will be given the same number of “late days” as there are assignments, which is 10 this year. For each assigment you can use up to three of your late days quota, each one allowing you to submit the assignment one day later. <strong>The quantum of lateness is the day, so if you are 15 seconds late that counts as a day late.</strong> If you have a cold or flu you can use the late days for such absences; if you have an extended excused absence contact the instructor and we can work something out.</p>

<h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>

<p>Office hours will be pinned on CampusWire where the Zoom rooms for office hours will also be listed.</p>

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

<p>There will be a midterm before spring break and a final examination during the normal final exam period.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>The final will count around 1/3 of the grade, the midterm 1/6th, and the homeworks the rest. The HWs will be weighed somewhat differently based on the time commitment of the assignment.</p>
