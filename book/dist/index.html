    <h2><strong>FbDK</strong>: The <strong>Fb</strong> Development Kit</strong></h2>
    <p>
      <strong>FbDK</strong> is a framework for writing the interpreters
      discussed in the book.  The binaries are fully working versions
      of the interpreters, but the source distribution is simply the
      framework with a dummy implementation of the interpreters.  The
      source distrubition is released under the same license as the
      book.  The binaries may be downloaded and freely used, but we
      reserve all rights to the binaries themselves and the source
      code from which they were produced.
