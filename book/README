This directory is no longer generated by the book makefile.  The FbDK and book are now independent.

To update the book, make the book and just replace the book.pdf file (git rm the old one, git add the new one).

To update the fbdk, just make dist in the fbdk and replace the _dist directory with the fbdk/_dist directory (git rm -r the old one and git add the new one).
