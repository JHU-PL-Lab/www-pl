This directory is no longer generated by the book makefile.  The FbDK and book are now independent.

Use the script ./update.sh to git pull the latest book and fbdk, build both, and put them in this book directory.  Then plcommit to push to web.

Here is what the script is doing.

To update the book, make the book and just replace the book.pdf file (git rm the old one, git add the new one).

To update the fbdk, just make dist in the fbdk and replace the _dist directory with the fbdk/_dist directory (git rm -r the old one and git add the new one).
