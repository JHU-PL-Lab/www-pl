                     <p><ul class="default">
  <li>This course is a study of the deeper <em>principles</em> behind programming
    language designs, and not of particular programming languages.</li>

  <li> We focus on fundamental language <em>features</em> such as data structures, functions, objects, types and concurrency, and how they interact with each other to achieve the desired expressiveness.</li>

  <li>We study features through the implementation of interpreters and through
    <em>operational semantics</em> and <em>type systems</em>, mathematical approaches to program meaning.</li>

  <li>The OCaml dialect of the ML programming language will be used.  OCaml
    has features including type inference, and higher-order functions that make it worthy of study in its own right.</li>
  <li>This course is mathematical in nature and so is recommended for upper-level undergraduate students with strong mathematics skills, or for graduate students. It is not recommended for sophomores.</li>
