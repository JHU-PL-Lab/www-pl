<h2>OCaIDE</h2>

OcaIDE is an Eclipse plugin for OCaml development.  It provides batch
compilation support, assistance with type information, an integrated OCaml
toploop, and even a debugger.  <em>(note, I could not get the debugger to
work; please let me know if the debugger works for you)</em>.  The <a
href="http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/">OCaIDE homepage</a>
contains all the information to install it; help is available
within Eclipse on how to use it.  <b>Warning:</b> Be sure that you have
installed OCaml <i>before</i> you install OcaIDE to make sure things go
smoothly.

<h3>Tips</h3>
Generally in the course materials we are assuming you are using emacs;
here are a few tips and tricks for usig OCaIDE instead.  These assume
you have already installed OCaIDE.

<ul>
    <li>Use Window -&gt; Open Perspective -&gt; Other .. and select OCaml to open the perspective if it is not already open.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the first couple homeworks, you'll want to use the "Ocaml Managed Project" variety of project.  This spares you the details of
        compilation and allows you to focus on learning the language.  It also
        allows you to view the types of various expressions in the editor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use Window -&gt; show View -&gt; OCaml Toplevel if you need to start a new top-loop,
        which appears below.  Type your input in the small lower window.
    </li>
    <li>
        For small fiddling in the top loop, make a new "module" (i.e., a .ml
        file), edit, select the code in the file with the mouse, and use the
        menu option Ocaml -&gt; Eval in Toplevel to submit it to the top loop in
        the window below.  F6 is usually a key shortcut for this commmand.
    </li>
    <li>
        To submit the whole file to the toploop as if you typed  it there,
        select everything and "Eval in Toplevel" as above.  There is a menu
        option "Load in Toplevel" which loads a whole file, but this option
        loads the bytecode and it loads it as a module (i.e., it
        <code>#use</code>s it).  Another way is to use the "load in toplevel"
        and then type #open Myfilename to the toplevel to make your functions
        directly available in the toplevel (where myfilename.ml is the file you
        were editing).
    </li>
    <li>
        For the homeworks which use the F&#x266d;DK (F&#x266d; development kit),
        you should set up your project differently.  For Linux or Mac users,
        the following instructions apply:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Create an "OCaml Makefile" project (<i>not</i> an empty Makefile
                project).
            </li>
            <li>
                Extract the contents of the FbDK archive into the project
                directory (not from within eclipse, use your shell or file browser outside of Eclipse).  Note that files such as "configure" should be in
                your project's root directory, not in a subfolder.
            </li>
            <li>
                From the console, run <code>./configure</code> from within the
                Eclipse project directory to create the makefile.
            </li>
            <li>Refresh the project from within Eclipse.</li>
            <li>Select "Clean Project" from the Project menu to build your project.</li>
            <li>
                In the Run Configurations dialog, create a new OCaml Executable
                configuration.  Type the project name here exactly as you typed
                it before and browse for the "Fb" executable in the project
                directory.  You may now use the run configuration to run your
                interpreter.
            </li>
        </ol>
        For Windows users, the following set of alternate instructions may be
        helpful:
        <ol>
            <li>Create a new OCaml Managed Project.</li>
            <li>
                Extract the contents of the FbDK archive into the project
                directory.  The project's directory should immediately contain
                the file "configure".
            </li>
            <li>Refresh the project from within Eclipse.</li>
            <li>
                In the project's Properties dialog, choose the Builder panel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Uncheck "Ocaml Builder".  You will get a warning message; press
                OK.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the New button to create a new builder.  Choose "Program"
                and name this builder "FbDK batch builder".
            </li>
            <li>
                Under Location, browse the workspace and select
                "win32Build.bat".  (If it does not appear in the dialog, try
                refreshing your project again, confirm that the file is in the
                project from within Eclipse, and then resume from step 3 above.) 
            </li>
            <li>
                Under Working Directory, browse the workspace and select the
                project directory.
            </li>
            <li>
                Under the Refresh tab, check the box named "Refresh resources
                upon completion."
            </li>
            <li>
                Under the Build Options tab, check the box named "During auto
                builds."
            </li>
            <li>
                Press OK to apply the new builder and leave the properties
                dialog.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select "Build All" from the Project menu to build the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the Run Configurations dialog, create a new OCaml Executable
                configuration.  Type the project name here exactly as you typed
                it before and browse for the "Fb" executable in the project
                directory.  You may now use the run configuration to run your
                interpreter.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you make changes to <code>fbinterp.ml</code>, you will need
                to view the Console for errors.  Because the OcaIDE builder has
                been disabled, the errors reported by Eclipse are meaningless.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <li>
        You may want to use the top loop to interact with
        <strong>F&#x266d;</strong> rather than the executable; for that, edit
        the fbdktoploop.ml file, select all, and  Eval in Toplevel.  Now you
        have all the functions in that file available in the top loop
        below.  Note that this step will not automatically rebuild - you
        must perform it manually each time you save changes.  You will need
        to uncomment the "#cd" command to point the toploop to the right
        location to load the files.
    </li>
</ul>
