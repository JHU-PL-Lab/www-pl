## Exam Study Guide

### Overview

*   The exam covers all of the lecture materials. Most of the topics in the book should be considered as covered, but those book sections completely skipped will not be on the final.
*   While OCaml questions are fair on the final, it is not a focus of the exam.
*   The previous finals below collectively will give a pretty good idea of the scope of the exam; different topics are asked different years as there is no time to quiz every topic.
*   The final is written to take 1.5 hours and it is in a three-hour slot.  So, if you studied you should not have a time problem.
*   You will be allowed to bring one 8.5x11 piece of paper hand-written on both sides. You cannot copy someone else's sheet, you need to write your own (collaboration on it is fine though, just don't copy).
