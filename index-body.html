                           <h3>Course Summary</h3>
                           <p><ul class="default">
        <li>&bull; This course is a study of the deeper <em>principles</em> behind programming
          language designs, and not of particular programming languages.</li>
      
        <li>&bull;  We focus on fundamental language <em>features</em> such as data structures, functions, objects, types and concurrency, and how they interact with each other to achieve the desired expressiveness.</li>
      
        <li>&bull; We study features through the implementation of interpreters and through
          <em>operational semantics</em> and <em>type systems</em>, mathematical approaches to program meaning.</li>        
      
          <li>&bull; We study the "algebra of programs" (how features and programs relate), through <em>macro encodings</em> and <em>operational equivalence</em> (when one program equals another in behavior)</li>
      
        <li>&bull; We will learn basics of functional programming via the OCaml programming language.  OCaml
          has features including type inference that make it worthy of study in its own right.</li>

        <li>&bull; This course is mathematical in nature and so is recommended for upper-level undergraduate students with strong mathematics skills, or for graduate students. It is not recommended for sophomores.</li>
