<title>DIPL Course Supplementary Resources</title>
<h1> Course Supplementary Resources </h1>
There is a lot of related material out there, but unfortunately everyone 
uses different notation and different languages (Scheme being the most 
widespread), and the topics covered also vary widely.
You will find just about everything we cover in this course somewhere else.
<p>  
Here is a list of resources available.  Comments on the usefulness of any 
of these resources would be very much appreciated.

<h2> General References </h2>

The book <cite> Essentials of Programming Languages </cite> by Friedman,
Wand, and Haynes.  This book covers similar material to what we will
be covering in this course, but is based on the Scheme programming
language and not on SML.  If you are familiar with Scheme (or Lisp,
which is very similar to Scheme), this book could be a very useful
supplementary text.  <p>

Shriram at Rice has <A HREF="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~shriram/311/">lecture 
notes</A> which cover a number of the topics we are covering but in Scheme 
instead of ML.
<p>

Gary Leavens has <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~leavens/ComS541/lectures/">lecture notes</A> 
covering operational semantics as well as   
other topics in programming languages. 
<p>

Ramsey at Virginia also has <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~nr/cs655/lectures.html">notes</A> which 
are more Scheme-based.
<p>

The book <cite> Semantics of Programming Languages</cite> by Carl Gunter
(chapters 1, 2, and 7 only).  This book covers a lot of material we
are not interested in, but chapter 2 gives a nice introduction to the
typed lambda calculus and chapter 7 covers type inference.<p>
<p>

If you want to grub around on the web and waste lots of time finding 
things that aren't quite related to what we are doing, see 
the <A 
HREF="http://www.cis.temple.edu/courses-lang.html">language courses 
page</A> and Leavens'  <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~leavens/teaching-prog-lang/home.html">Programming 
languages courses page</A>.  Let me know if you find anything useful so I 
can add it to this page.

<h2> Operational Semantics </h2>
The book <cite> The Semantics of Programming Languages </cite> by Matthew
Hennessy.  This book is a sophmore-level treatment of operational
semantics.  If you are in need of
a tutorial on operational semantics this book is highly recommended.<p>

Nick Benton has written some <a href = ../notes/benton-lect.ps>
nice lecture notes</a> covering some  basic topics.  <p>

Matthias Felleisen has written extensive <a href = ../notes/felleisen-notes
.ps>
lecture notes</a> which give more depth than you probably need.  He also doesn't use 
the big step formalism.<p>

See Leavens <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~leavens/ComS541/lectures/operational-semantics">lecture 
notes</A> as well.

<h2>Grammars, Scanning and Parsing</h2>
This is a classic topic, and is covered in depth in any compilers
textbook.  In fact it is about 1/2 of the material of many compilers courses.
<ul>
  <li> Aho, Sethi, Ullman, <em>Compilers</em> (Addison-Wesley) is the standard.
  <li> LeBlanc and Fisher, <em>Crafting a Compiler with C</em>
       (Benjamin-Cummings) is another source.
  <li> The Friedman et al book cited above devotes Chapter 11 to
       scanning and parsing.
</ul>

<H2>Compiling by Program Transformation</H2>

Well, I can't find much here.  A detailed reference is Andrew Appel's 
book, <cite>Compiling With Continuations</cite>.  He unfortunately uses 
the CPS transformation and not the A-transformation we use.

<H2>Type Systems</H2>
<cite> Semantics of Programming Languages</cite> by Carl Gunter.<p>

Pierce's <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/pierce/pierce/ftp/typescourse/">types 
course notes</A>--quite a bit of material here.
<p>

Leavens' <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~leavens/ComS541/lectures/types">lecture 
notes</A>.
<p>

Dave Schmidt has a book, <cite>The Structure of Typed Programming 
Languages </cite>
which I am not very familiar with but should cover the basic concepts.  

<h2>Type Inference</h2>

Ramsey has <A 
HREF="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~nr/cs655/lectures/ml-printing.ps">lecture 
notes</A> on the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm.
<p>

Alex Aiken also has some very good <A 
HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.edu/~aiken/cs164/lectures/lecture15-new.4.ps">
notes</A> on this topic.
<p>

The book <cite>Programming Languages</cite>
by Reade also presents the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm, as 
does <cite>Semantics of Programming Languages</cite> by Carl Gunter.
