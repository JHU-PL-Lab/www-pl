<h2> Requirements:  </h2>

<p>
8 Machine Problems (50%), midterm (25%), final exam (25%).

<h2> Prerequisites:  </h2>

<p>
Data Structures or the equivalent, and some previous knowledge of Lisp or
Scheme. The first two weeks of the course will include an intensive
introduction to Scheme (a dialect of Lisp).

<h2> Goals and Themes: </h2>

<p> Our first goal is to learn how a variety of programming language features
and mechanisms may be understood by specifying them in a very-high-level
language such as Scheme.  Our second goal is to learn how these features may
be implemented by systematically transforming our high-level specification
into a low-level systems language such as Scheme (or Pascal or C or ...).

<h2> Machine Problems:  </h2>

<p>
There will be approximately 8 machine problems, each of which will take about
a week to complete.  These are very important.  They are how you really learn
the material.  In general, it is not possible to succeed in the course without
doing the machine problems.

<h2> Computing: </h2>

<p> Computing will be done in Chez Scheme on the Sparc workstations
located in room 201 CN.  Dial-up access will be available.  Details
will be found in the manuals packet.
