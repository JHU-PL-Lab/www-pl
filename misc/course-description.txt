Design and Implementation of Programming Languages 600.426
3 credits

This course departs from the traditional programming languages course
which surveys a number of programming languages.  Instead, functional,
object-oriented, and other language features are studied independent
of a particular programming language.  Students will become familiar
with these features by implementing them.  Most of the implementations
will be in the form of small language interpreters.  Some type
checkers and a small compiler will also be written.  The total amount
of code written will not be overly large, as the emphasis will be on
concepts.  The ML programming language will be the implementation
language used in the course.  ML includes features such as type
inference, a functional basis, and an advanced module system, that
make it worthy of study in its own right.

Prereq: Data structures
